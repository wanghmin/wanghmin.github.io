 abstract = {Whenever the concept of high-performance cloth simulation is brought up, GPU acceleration is almost always the first that comes to mind. Leveraging immense parallelization, GPU algorithms have demonstrated significant success recently, whereas CPU methods are somewhat overlooked. Indeed, the need for an efficient CPU simulator is evident and pressing. In many scenarios, high-end GPUs may be unavailable or are already allocated to other tasks, such as rendering and shading. A high-performance CPU alternative can greatly boost the overall system capability and user experience. Inspired by this demand, this paper proposes a CPU algorithm for high-resolution cloth simulation. By partitioning the garment model into multiple (but not massive) sub-meshes or domains, we assign per-domain computations to individual CPU processors. Borrowing the idea of projective dynamics that breaks the computation into global and local steps, our key contribution is a new parallelization paradigm at domains for both global and local steps so that domain-level calculations are sequential and lightweight. The CPU has much fewer processing units than a GPU. Our algorithm mitigates this disadvantage by wisely balancing the scale of the parallelization and convergence. We validate our method in a wide range of simulation problems involving high-resolution garment models. Performance-wise, our method is at least one order faster than existing CPU methods, and it delivers a similar performance compared with the state-of-the-art GPU algorithms in many examples, but without using a GPU.},
