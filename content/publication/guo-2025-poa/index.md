abstract: With the rise of digital fashion, reusing high-quality garment assets to
  assemble new outfits has become increasingly important for improving design efficiency
  and reducing production costs. However, combining multiple garments often introduces
  complex inter-garment intersections that are difficult to resolve. In this paper,
  we propose a novel framework that introduces a midsurface representation to simplify
  multilayered garments for intersection-free outfit assembly. Each garment is approximated
  by a watertight tetrahedral enclosure, enabling efficient resolution of inter-garment
  collisions on the midsurface level. To assemble an outfit, our method progressively
  untangles pairs of single-layer midsurfaces and incrementally constructs a merged
  midsurface. To recover the intersection-free full geometry from these deformed midsurfaces
  and enable instantaneous transfer across different poses, we uses embedded anchors
  to drive inversion-free deformation of enclosing tetrahedral cages. Through various
  examples, we demonstrate that our method provides a scalable and automated solution
  for virtual outfit coordination, enabling the direct reuse of garment assets in
  high-fidelity, collision-free digital fashion workflows.
